    <h1 class="text-center headers">What is the Undertow?</h1>
    <p class="writing">Dr. Akemi hasn't talked much about where, when, or how she got her Eidolon. While it would be
        helpful in our research, due to the nature of Eidolons we understand that it can be rather personal and that we
        can't force her to tell us what she isn't comfortable sharing. However, it is very clear she knows a lot more
        than she's been letting on, and that brings us to this - <em>The Undertow</em> is very much involved with
        Eidolons. It is where they sleep until they're awakened and where they get their powers from.</p>
    <p class="writing">We here at the ESL have another name for phenomena that we will explain in a moment and refer
        back to for the rest of this document, but we want to make it clear here that this is the name Dr. Akemi refered
        to it by, and Dr. Rikimaru's research into Eidolons prior to Project Sleep shows that the Undertow has been
        known about for centuries but brushed off as simply "magic" much like Eidolon powers were. We wanted to make it
        clear
        that it has another name that it's been referred to long before now, but we have a different view of it that we
        want to discuss. To get the point across, the Undertow is an alternate universe made entirely of psychic energy.
        When we enter REM Sleep while resting, our minds slowly drift off into the Undertow, and this experience is what
        we know as <em>dreams</em>. In these dreams, there's a very low chance that you may find a door, one that is out
        of place or unfitting to the environment somehow. If you open it, you'll discover what we refer to as <em>"The
            Nexus"</em>.</p>
    <p class="writing">The Nexus is <em>our</em> name for the Undertow, which we feel is a better description. It was
        called the Undertow due to people comparing it to a sea of psychic energy which everyone was caught up in, but
        from our occassional expeditions of this realm once we'd found all found our doors in our dreams, we came to
        realize what it was - a collective subconscious, and we were at the center of it. Doors in a black space as far
        as the eye can see, each one representing a human who has existed, is currently alive, and maybe even will exist
        in the future. From here, we learned that we could enter other people's dreams worlds, and discovered just how
        deep
        this rabbit hole goes.</p>
    <p class="writing">Being able to enter other people's dreams at all is a curious experience. We've had to make a
        distiction between real people and the individuals found in those dreams as a result of a few nasty encounters
        while exploring dreamworlds. Most "people" you meet in the dreamworld aren't human - they're what Dr. Akemi
        refer to as <em>Shades</em>, beings born of spiritual energies from the individuals the dreamworld belongs to.
        They can look like almost anything, and seem capable of doing almost anything as well - we haven't gotten many
        chances to study them in a safe environment. If we could pull them out of the Nexus, we would, but we don't have
        the means to do that yet. Regardless, not all Shades are receptive to outsiders entering their dreamworlds
        unwanted, and will do what they can to remove you. We don't think they can kill you - it's just a dream after
        all - but it's best to be safe and avoid them if you can. It can be quite difficult to tell Shades apart from
        real humans sometimes, so if you're exploring the Nexus, do so in a small group and stay together as best you
        can as to not get lost. If you get lost, do not look for your group - it's not impossible that you'll find
        Shades that look like them first. Instead, try to <em>wake up.</em></p>
    <p class="writing">This also provides a fair bit of insight at to how Eidolons work, though the nature of dreams
        make testing difficult. As it stands, even if we find something that could be someone's sleeping Eidolon, we
        can't forcibly wake it up from the dream world with our current ability. Being able to study Eidolons in their
        "natural habitat" so to speak could help us learn how to wake them easier in the future, however.</p>
    <p class="writing">The rest of this page will be dedicated to less concrete notes - things Dr. Akemi has said or Dr.
        Rikimaru has found in his research, as well as our own experiences. Eidolons and the Nexus are deeply ingrained
        in mysticism, and sometimes the scientific method doesn't yield results we can make sense of at the moment. With
        more intense research and focus on these topics, we may be able to learn more, but as it stands we're dipping
        into questions not in our field - stuff like philosophy, or <em>quantum mechanics</em>. What it means to be
        human and how the universe functions are fundamental questions at the center of all of this as two basic
        examples - what does having access to these abilities mean? Why does the Nexus exist? We don't yet know how to
        find these answers. While we keep looking, we figured it'd be worthwhile writing down some tangentially related
        information for our own sake, to keep notes and compare with later when we have better answers.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center headers">The Phantom Clock</h1>
    <p class="writing"><em>"The Phantom Clock"</em> is a method of measuring the effects of group morale and tension
        within relationships on the Nexus, especially among Eidolon users. It builds up slowly over time the more you
        use your Eidolon or interact with the Nexus in any way that might have negative consequences. Like a typical
        modern day clock, there are 12 "hours" to the Phantom Clock. Starting at 1, the moment the clock hits 3 the next
        use of an Eidolon or attempt to affect the Nexus will have a high likelihood to fail, but afterwards things will
        be unchanged. After 6, the clock starts moving faster, even seeming to move on its own. During one of our
        experiments, Dr. Akemi just muttered "It's at 8 now..." out of nowhere, and when pressed on it all she said was
        that "The Phantom Clock ticked"... but didn't explain what we did to cause it, when previously it was a lot more
        clear. At 9, using Eidolons becomes mentally strenuous unless someone is there to help you - ever since the
        first time we've hit 9, we've made it a rule that Eidolons must not be used when alone, both to keep an eye on
        the Phantom Clock and to always have someone nearby to help. Finally, when the clock hits 12 for a select group,
        someone will lose control of their Eidolon - Dr. Akemi refers to bezerk Eidolons as <em>"Phantoms"</em>.
        Phantoms are tied to the associated Eidolon user's mental state, and as such ever since the first time we hit 12
        on the Phantom Clock, what we refer to as "The Salmhofer Incident" due to Dr. Akemi's Eidolon becoming a
        Phantom, we've made an effort to look out for each other's mental health as best as we can so that we can look
        out for their safety as well as our own, but also so that when the next Eidolon becomes a Phantom we may be able
        to better understand them...</p>

    <h1 class="text-center headers">The Fate Deck</h1>
    <p class="writing"><em>"The Fate Deck"</em> is a method of measuring the quantum state of the Nexus - in other
        words, it's a representation of "luck" and "chance" and how the Nexus relates to it. From Dr. Rikimaru's
        research, the most well known interpretation of it is tied to tarot cards - the Major Arcana, specifically.</p>
    <p class="writing">Every person's skills and personality is taken into account with the Fate Deck - those who are
        good at something will "draw more cards" and thus have more options as it pertains to what the Fate Deck gives
        them. By performing an action, they "choose a card" so to speak, and that dictates how well that action goes for
        them. The deck is split into 3 types of cards: Positive, Neutral, and Negative cards. Positive cards lead to
        good outcomes for the individual to varying degrees whereas Negatives cards lead to bad outcomes. Neutral cards
        don't have any inherent value as to whether you succeed or fail at your action, but tend to act more as
        <em>descriptors</em> as the Forecast is more important for such cards. Neutral Cards aren't Neutral for everyone
        either, as every person has a <em>Resonant</em> card, which is Positive for them and when it comes up provides
        chances to excel with their particular skillset, and a <em>Dissonant</em> card, which is Negative for them and
        represents when their own weaknesses get in the way.</p>
    <p class="writing">The Fate Deck represents an ebb and flow to day to day life - if something Positive happens now,
        it'll be less likely to happen later when you may need it more, whereas if something Negative happens to you,
        you can rest assured that the moment has passed and it'll be less likely to happen again anytime soon.
        Theoretically you could end up drawing negative after negative card if you're having a really bad day, but that
        just leaves all the Positive cards for later!</p>
