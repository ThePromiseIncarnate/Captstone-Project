    <h1 class="text-center headers">What is the Undertow?</h1>
    <p class="writing">Dr. Akemi hasn't talked much about where, when, or how she got her Eidolon. While it would be
        helpful in our research, due to the nature of Eidolons we understand that she it can be rather personal and that
        we can't force her to tell us what she isn't comfortable sharing. However, it is very clear she knows a lot more
        than she's been letting on, and that brings us to this - <em>The Undertow</em> is very much involved with
        Eidolons. It is where they sleep until they're awakened and where they get their powers from.</p>
    <p class="writing">We here at the ESL have another name for phenomena that we will explain in a moment and refer
        back to for the rest of this document, but we want to make it clear here that this is the name Dr. Akemi refered
        to it by, and Dr. Rikimaru's research into Eidolons prior to Project Sleep shows that the Undertow has been
        known about for centuries but brushed off as "magic" much like Eidolon powers were. We wanted to make it clear
        that it has another name that it's been referred to long before now, but we have a different view of it that we
        want to discuss. To get the point across, the Undertow is an alternate universe made entirely of psychic energy.
        When we enter REM Sleep while resting, our minds slowly drift off into the Undertow, and this experience is what
        we know as <em>dreams</em>. According to research over the past centuries done on the topic, we've struggled
        with why dreams and sleep are important - the most we knew was that if we didn't sleep we'd die, and that dreams
        had something to do with memory. The Undertow may hold the answers to both these questions, but that's neither
        here nor there right now. In these dreams, there's a very low chance that you may find a door, one that is out
        of place or unfitting to the environment somehow. If you open it, you'll discover what we refer to as <em>"The
            Nexus"</em>.</p>
    <p class="writing">The Nexus is <em>our</em> name for the Undertow, which we feel is a better description. It was
        called the Undertow due to people comparing it to a see of psychic energy which everyone was caught up in, but
        from our occassional expeditions of this realm once we'd found all found our doors in our dreams, we came to
        realize what it was - a collective consciousness, and we were at the center of it. Doors in a black space as far
        as the eye can see, each one a human who has existed, is currently alive, and maybe even will exist in the
        future. From here, we learned that we could enter other people's dreams worlds, and discovered just how deep
        this rabbit hole goes.</p>
    <p class="writing">First to establish: Being able to enter other people's dreams at all is a curious experience.
        We've had to make a distiction between real people and the individuals found in those dreams as a result of a
        few nasty encounters while exploring dreamworlds. Most "people" you meet in the dreamworld aren't human -
        they're what Dr. Akemi refer to as <em>Shades</em>, beings born of spiritual energies from the individuals the
        dreamworld belongs to. They can look like almost anything, and seem capable of doing almost anything as well -
        we haven't gotten many chances to study them in a safe environment. If we could pull them out of the Nexus, we
        would, but we don't have the means to do that yet. Regardless, not all Shades are receptive to outsiders
        entering their dreamworlds unwanted, and will do what they can to remove you. We don't think they can kill you -
        it's just a dream after all - but it's best to be safe and avoid them if you can. It can be quite difficult to
        tell Shades apart from real humans sometimes, so if you're exploring the Nexus, do so in a small group and stay
        together as best as you can as to not get lost. If you get lost, do not look for your group - it's not
        impossible that they'll be Shades that look like them. Instead, try to <em>wake up.</em></p>
    <p class="writing">Second thing: This provides a fair bit of insight at to how Eidolons work, though the nature of
        dreams make testing difficult. As it stands, even if we find something that could be someone's sleeping Eidolon,
        we can't forcibly wake it up from the dream world with our current ability. Being able to study Eidolons in
        their "natural habitat" so to speak could help us learn how to wake them easier in the future, however.</p>
    <p class="writing">The rest of this page will be dedicated to less concrete notes - things Dr. Akemi has said or Dr.
        Rikimaru has found in his research, as well as our own experiences. Eidolons and the Nexus are deeply ingrained
        in mysticism, and sometimes the scientific method doesn't yield results we can make sense of at the moment. With
        more intense research and focus on these topics, we may be able to learn more, but as it stands we're dipping
        into questions not in our field - stuff like philosophy, or <em>quantum mechanics</em>. What it means to be
        human and how the universe functions are fundamental questions at the center of all of this as two basic
        examples - what does having access to these abilities mean? Why does the Nexus exist? We don't yet know how to
        find these answers. While we keep looking, we figured it'd be worthwhile writing down some tangentially related
        information for our own sake, to keep notes and compare with later when we have better answers.</p>
