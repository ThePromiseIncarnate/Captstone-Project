        <h1 class="text-center">What is Project Sleep?</h1>
        <p>Over the course of the last decade of research and experimentation, we have stumbled upon a fascinating discovery: all of the old stories and fairy tales are true, magic is real, and we believe we know where it comes from. The purpose of "Project Sleep" now is to discover how to awaken these magical abilities, these "Eidolons", in individuals consistently without unwated side effects or harm. We believe these Eidolons to be the key to unlocking human potential - your average man could be superhuman, the workforce would experience potentially a 100% boost in efficiency, and <em>our soldiers would be nigh unstoppable by any normal man.</em> Not Eden, not even just Japan, but all of humanity would prosper!</p>
