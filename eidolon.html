    <h1 class="text-center">What are Eidolons?</h1>
    <p><em>Eidolons</em> are representations of your psyche, as well as of your subconcious mind - they are the hidden
        parts of your personality given form to help you do things you normally couldn't do. They are typically found in
        the Undertow in a state we refer to as <em>"asleep"</em>, and can be <em>"awoken"</em> through sleeping or
        meditation. We have looked into other methods of waking Eidolons, but so far we haven't had any luck.</p>
    <p>Eidolon users are granted many superhuman capabilities including superior strength, reflexes, and durability as
        well as the ability to heal wounds faster and easier, ontop of anything unique to the Eidolon itself. Eidolons
        depend on the individual's personality and needs in the moment of attaining an Eidolon, though the through-line
        isn't always obvious as a result of being non-literal, based on the subconcious. We group Eidolons into
        different types which we refer to as "Playbooks", coined by Dr. Akemi due to how much it's affected by both the
        user's life and how it may affect their life afterwards, like some kind of plan for them. These Playbooks will
        be described in detail below:</p>

                    <p><em>Alchemist Eidolons</em> have the unique ability to transform things with a simple touch -
                        what defines a "touch" can be debated, as even metaphysical concepts and non-physical ideas like
                        emotions fall under the effects of this power, the scope of these abilities cannot be
                        understated. Users of Alchemist Eidolons tend to be very creative, goal-driven individuals,
                        people who want to change the world in some way - hopefully for the better. From our research,
                        we've found that their effective range tends to be 3 meters, and anything they transform can be
                        reverted back. They also seem capable of subconciously affecting fate, as occassionally things
                        just go exactly as they expect for better or worse. At their best, when they find the perfect
                        answer to a problem and act on it immediately, even <em>they</em> seem to change to better fit
                        the situation! But at their worst, it's almost like they crumple under the weight of the
                        world...</p>
                    <p>Dr. Aoki's Eidolon <em>[Rust]</em> is an Alchemist Eidolon resembling a rusty, humanoid
                        automaton that corrodes anything it touches. As concerning as this may seem, we try and look at
                        the
                        brightside of things around here at the Eden Satellite and Laboratory - making things weaker and
                        easier to break can be a useful asset, if she had developed this Eidolon when she was younger
                        she likely could've gone into demolition.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got an Alchemist Eidolon resembling a robotic clown,
                        <em>[Clown]</em>, which "turned laughter into fear". No further comments.
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe Dr. Kaneko's Eidolon <em>[Rewound]</em> to be an Alchemist Eidolon resembling a
                        robotic avian with limited time manipulation abilities, transforming the state of things to a
                        previous state. It doesn't seem to require touch, so it could be warping reality around itself
                        like a Conductor, but the fact he actively has to use his ability rather than it just...
                        passively doing so is the main reason we believe it to be Alchemist, ontop of him not exactly
                        fitting the personality of a Conductor Eidolon user. More testing likely necessary.</p>
                    <p>We have no reason to believe all Alchemist Eidolons appear robotic - this is purely a
                        coincedence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-conductor" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-conductor-list">
                    <p><em>Conductor Eidolons</em> passively "warp" reality within a radius of approximately 4.6 meters
                        around the Eidolon, the user, or anyone the Eidolon is close to. Users of Conductor Eidolons
                        tend to be very witty, charismatic individuals, or at the very least show positive traits to
                        those they consider close in their social circles - those of which can choose to exclude
                        themselves from the Eidolon's reality altering effects if the user allows them to. At their
                        best, they seem to be born leaders - they say the word, and everyone will act to do it, even if
                        their unique power doesn't specifically involve giving commands. At their worst, they can hardly
                        speak, and when they do they either say the worst things or the worst things happen, even if it
                        seems impossible or unreasonable by any normal metric.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Maekawa's Eidolon <em>[Kaleidoscope Haze]</em> is a Conductor Eidolon resembling a pink,
                        plush elephant toy, and it warps reality by changing the visuals of the area within its range
                        based on the personality of those that inhabit it. Children and some young adults, like Dr.
                        Maekawa himself, in the Eidolon's range make things brighter and highly saturated with a cutesy
                        anime style. When Dr. Kaneko is in its range, the area around him becomes black and white like
                        films from the early 20th century. When Dr. Rikimaru is in its range, the area around him
                        becomes darker and resembles early 21st century computer animated graphics. Multiple people
                        being in the bubble usually fuses their "unique perspectives" together.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got a Conductor Eidolon resembling a mechanical spider with a
                        baby doll's head, <em>[Broken Toy Mania]</em>, which brings toys within its range to life if
                        they are "broken" in any way. Broken can mean anywhere from scratched slightly or having a
                        malfunctioning voice box to being ripped apart or having shattered plastic parts. As long as the
                        toy isn't completely and utterly destroyed beyond recognizability, it will start trying to move
                        of its own accord, and some even have the ability to speak. They usually do not have positive
                        things to say.</p>

                    <p><em>Infiltrator Eidolons</em> have the ability to hide in some fashion with a secondary ability
                        it can use while it's hidden, and have typically shown to have an effective range of
                        approximately 15.2 meters. Users of Infiltrator Eidolons tend to be introverted or shy
                        individuals - they can be difficult to get a read on because they purposely hide things about
                        themselves. Some may believe an Eidolon like this is inherently malevolent or implies something
                        negative about its user, but we here at the ESL see the <em>potential</em> in these Eidolons.
                        Spies and soldiers aren't the only individuals who need to use stealth to get what they want,
                        after all. Infiltrator Eidolons can only hide when they aren't being viewed under most normal
                        circumstances, and can stay hidden for seemingly arbitrary amounts of time dependent on if
                        people are looking for them and what they do while they're hidden. Users of Infiltrator Eidolons
                        also tend to know how to pick locks or hack computers that they previously might not have had,
                        though it's also just as likely that those with such skills are more likely to have Infiltrator
                        Eidolons. At their best, they can be utterly undetectable until its too late, often giving them
                        an advantage in whatever situation they're in. But when things go wrong for them, they're
                        utterly helpless as their Eidolon can outright become unusable...</p>
                    <p>Dr. Akemi's Eidolon <em>[Escape of Salmholfer the Witch]</em> resembles a woman in a black dress
                        which can transform into an apple, which Dr. Akemi can then throw. While her Eidolon is an
                        apple,
                        non-Eidolon users can see it. Dr. Akemi is the first of us to get an Eidolon - we don't know
                        where she got it, just that it seems to be what inspired Dr. Rikimaru to propose Project Sleep
                        to the officials funding the ESL. It's a simple Eidolon, but has proven useful - especially
                        since it seems she can hide alongside her Eidolon in the apple and send the apple flying with
                        her
                        own will. Being able to become an object as small as an apple and still move swiftly means she
                        can easily get into areas that normal humans cannot.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got an Infiltrator Eidolon, <em>[Cantarella]</em>, resembling
                        a creature made out of flowers that rather than hiding instead makes people hallucinate, and
                        while doing so it can also poison them. This poison enters the blood system through the skin and
                        also seems to attack the brain through the nervous system, making it harder for the victim to
                        shake the hallucination. The poison cannot be identified by our current technology.</p>

                    <p><em>Navigator Eidolons</em> have the simple but very useful ability to sense any specific things
                        within its range of 7.6 meters. Users of Navigator Eidolons tend to be very organized,
                        knowledgable individuals who are experts in their field. Much like Conductors, they tend toward
                        leadership positions, but show very different leadership traits - they're not always as
                        charismatic, but in the right career intelligence may be valued more(not to say that you can't
                        be both charismatic <em>and</em> intelligent). Users of Navigator Eidolons seem to be ready for
                        anything - similar to users of Alchemist Eidolons they have some kind of control over fate, but
                        unlike the Alchemist it's a lot more direct, a bit more of a conscious effort, less "going with
                        the flow" and more as if they have a plan for everything. At their best, they seem to know
                        everything about the current situation and the best direction forward. At their worst, they can
                        come off as stubborn, and that's likely to cost them greatly.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Rikimaru's Eidolon <em>[Masked]</em> resembles a plain white mask that he wears, and with it
                        he says he can see someone's "potential". He explains it with... very contradictory terms, it's
                        almost like his Eidolon can do almost anything and everything, but from what I gather from his
                        descriptions, when he sees through the eyeholes of the mask, he can see faint glimpses of what
                        someone's Eidolon may look like if it's asleep as well as a glow around people. He hasn't
                        explained what the glow means or how it applies to "potential", but he's said that Dr. Akemi's
                        son Hoshiki glows very brightly when Dr. Rikimaru wears the mask. In spite of being the project
                        head, he refuses to do more testing with his Eidolon...</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got a Navigator Eidolon, <em>[Let's Be Honest]</em>, which
                        resembles a young teenager girl who sensed when people were lying. A supernatural, perfect lie
                        detector is <em>very</em> useful, but I'll have to admit the individual who owned this Eidolon
                        was a strange one... He made a lot of the scientists uncomfortable, and not just because an
                        annoying girl was calling them out on every lie they said casually even when not testing.</p>

                    <p><em>Vanguard Eidolons</em> are generally combat-focused, with high destructive potential to
                        anything within 3 meters of the user in even the best of cases. Users of Vanguard Eidolons are
                        determined, extroverted individuals who often wear their hearts on their sleeve and even if they
                        aren't always the most charismatic or welcoming they can be quite friendly! They can be
                        optimistic or stubborn, sometimes both, in the face of adversity - one common phrase we've heard
                        consistently from Vanguard Eidolon users compared to other Eidolon users in our tests has been
                        "I meant to do that"... and honestly, it's hard not to believe them sometimes. At their best,
                        they can push through any obstacle with the right motivation. At their worst, their mistakes can
                        be costly, and if their mistake is genuine they usually come out feeling weaker than ever.</p>
                    <p>None of the scientists working on Project Sleep so far have developed Vanguard Eidolons, but one
                        of our anonymous test subjects developed one, <em>[Monstrosity]</em>, which resembles a
                        tyrannosaurus rex skull to some extent and has the ability to shoot high-energy lasers from its

                    <p><em>Virtuoso Eidolons</em> are unique in the fact that they tend to be physical objects imbued
                        with psychic energy from the Undertow and directly tied to their users' souls. Their powers and
                        forms are as varied as the individuals who awaken them, with the only traits that truly connect
                        them all is the fact that they're physical rather than inherently spiritual or psychic in
                        nature, and the user can call their Eidolon to them from any range under most circumstances
                        almost as easily as any other Eidolon users can simply summon their Eidolon. Users of Virtuoso
                        Eidolons are effectively the exact opposite of Alchemists, being very literaly-minded
                        individuals, while being similar to Navigators in that they are experts in their chosen field.
                        Unlike Navigators however, their skills tend to always directly map onto their Eidolon's powers
                        and inversely they seem capable of using their Eidolon's powers for almost anything and
                        everything as long as it is even vaguely related to something they are proficient in, whereas
                        Navigators being knowledgable on a topic doesn't mean that what they sense relates to that topic
                        in any way. At their best, their Eidolons can literally transform, becoming more versatile or
                        stronger in some way to reflect its user's mastery in that moment. At their worst, it's almost
                        like they forget they have an Eidolon at all - supernatural solutions to problems just fly over
                        their heads sometimes.</p>
                    <p>None of the scientists working on Project Sleep so far have developed Virtuoso Eidolons yet. For
                        a while we thought Dr. Rikimaru's Eidolon might be a Virtuoso, but upon further testing it
                        shares more traits with Navigator Eidolons and also can't be seen by non-Eidolon users - it's
                        appearance as an simple object is misleading to many, but it indeed is not a "physical" one. His
                        daughter, however, awakened a Virtuoso Eidolon sometime before Project Sleep officially started,
                        a lariat she named <em>[Double Lariat]</em>. According to Dr. Rikimaru, she always seemed
                        interested in old, American cowboy movies and her obsession with them fueled her in learning
                        various skills related to cowboys, such as gun handling and animal handling. It's said that she
                        learned how to make an actual lariat herself on her own, and with it she could grab a bottle
                        thrown at her out of midair even before her Eidolon was touched by the Undertow. Now <em>[Double
                            Lariat]</em> seems to stretch and grab whatever she wants it to, no matter the distance!</p>

                    <p>We were curious about the potential of animals awakening Eidolons - we weren't sure if it was
                        possible, but with the proper precautions we figured it wouldn't hurt to try. Even after the
                        test on our lab rats failed, Dr. Rikimaru insisted on it, swearing up and down he saw a dog glow
                        brightly with his mask and wanted to see if it meant anything. Eventually, we got something. The
                        dog he was so obsessed with had a litter of puppies - only one survived the process, a young,
                        male shiba inu who we refer to as Sigma. Upon awakening its Eidolon, Sigma seemed capable of
                        human communication, as if speaking psychically into our minds with perfect Japanese. The pup
                        was understandably scared and confused, and its Eidolon, which it refers to as <em>[Mommy]</em>,
                        is overly aggressive, being a much larger dog. From the little we could gather on Sigma and its
                        Eidolon, it seems like its Eidolon responded to its lack of a mother after our experiments sadly
                        resulted in her passing away shortly after she had her puppies. Understandable, but upsetting
                        regardless...</p>
                    <p>We asked Dr. Rikimaru to drop any further animal research after these harrowing experience, but
                        there's been three instances of a dead cat found in the halls of Eden Labs - according to DNA
                        tests, <em>they're all the exact same cat.</em> Dr. Rikimaru was confronted about this shortly
                        after. We don't know the name of the cat's Eidolon, we haven't seen it in a while, nor have we
                        heard the cat speak, but we refer to this incident as "The Faulty Feline Philosophy", believing
                        the cat's Eidolon to be related to the old addage of cats having nine lives.</p>
