    <h1 class="text-center">What are Eidolons?</h1>
    <p><em>Eidolons</em> are representations of your psyche, as well as of your subconcious mind - they are the hidden
        parts of your personality given form to help you do things you normally couldn't do. They are typically found in
        the Undertow in a state we refer to as <em>"asleep"</em>, and can be <em>"awoken"</em> through sleeping or
        meditation. We have looked into other methods of waking Eidolons, but so far we haven't had any luck.</p>
    <p>Eidolons users are granted many superhuman capabilities including superior strength, reflexes, and durability as
        well as the ability to heal wounds faster and easier, ontop of anything unique to the Eidolon itself. Eidolons
        depend on the individual's personality and needs in the moment of attaining an Eidolon, though the through-line
        isn't always obvious as a result of being non-literal, based on the subconcious. We group Eidolons into
        different types which we refer to as "Playbooks", coined by Dr. Akemi due to how much it's affected by both the
        user's life and how it may affect their life afterwards, like some kind of plan for them. These Playbooks will
        be described in detail below:</p>

                    <p><em>Alchemist Eidolons</em> have the unique ability to transform things with a simple touch - what defines a "touch" can be debated, as even metaphysical concepts and non-physical ideas like emotions fall under the effects of this power, the scope of these abilities cannot be understated. Users of Alchemist Eidolons tend to be very creative, goal-driven individuals, people who want to change the world in some way - hopefully for the better. From our research, we've found that their effective range tends to be 3 meters, and anything they transform can be reverted back. They also seem capable of subconciously affecting fate, as occassionally things just go exactly as they expect for better or worse. At their best, when they find the perfect answer to a problem and act on it immediately, even <em>they</em> seem to change to better fit the situation! But at their worst, it's almost like they crumple under the weight of the world...</p>
                    <p>Dr. Aoki's Eidolon <em>[Rust]</em> is an Alchemist Eidolon resembling an rusty, humanoid automaton that corrodes anything it touches. As concerning as this may, we try and look at the brightside of things around here at the Eden Satellite and Laboratory - making things weaker and easier to break can be a useful asset, if she had developed this Eidolon when she was younger she likely could've gone into demolition.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got an Alchemist Eidolon resembling a robotic clown, <em>[Clown]</em>, which "turned laughter into fear". No further comments.</p>
                    <p>We believe Dr. Kaneko's Eidolon <em>[Rewound]</em> to be an Alchemist Eidolon resembling a robotic avian with limited time manipulation abilities, transforming the state of things to a previous state. It doesn't seem to require touch, so it could be warping reality around itself like a Conductor, but the fact he actively has to use his ability rather than it just... passively doing so is the main reason we believe it to be Alchemist, ontop of him not exactly fitting the personality of a Conductor Eidolon user. More testing likely necessary.</p>
                    <p>We have no reason to believe all Alchemist Eidolons appear robotic - this is purely a coincedence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-conductor" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-conductor-list">
                    <p><em>Conductor Eidolons</em> passively "warp" reality within a radius of approximately 4.6 meters around the Eidolon, the user, or anyone the Eidolon is close to. Users of Conductor Eidolons tend to be very witty, charismatic individuals, or at the very least show positive traits to those they consider close in their social circles - those of which can choose to exclude themselves from the Eidolon's reality altering effects if the user allows them too. At their best, they seem to be born leaders - they say the word, and everyone will act to do it, even if their unique power doesn't specifically involve giving commands. At their worst, they can hardly speak, and when they do they either say the worst things or the worst things happen, even if it seems impossible or unreasonable by any normal metric.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Maekawa's Eidolon <em>[Kaleidoscope Haze]</em> is a Conductor Eidolon resembling a pink, plush elephant toy, and it warps reality by changing the visuals of the area within its range based on the personality of those that inhabit it. Children and some young adults, like Dr. Maekawa himself, in the Eidolon's range make things brighter and highly saturated with a cutesy anime style. When Dr. Kaneko is in its range, the area around him becomes black and white like films from the early 20th century. When Dr. Rikimaru is in its range, the area around him becomes darker and resembles early 21st century computer animated graphics. Multiple people being in the bubble usually fuses their "unique perspectives" together.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got a Conductor Eidolon resembling a mechanical spider with a baby doll's head, <em>[Broken Toy Mania]</em>, which brings toys within its range to life if they are "broken" in any way. Broken can mean anywhere from scratched slightly or having a malfunctioning voice box to being ripped apart or having shattered plastic parts. As long as the toy isn't completely and utterly destroyed beyond recognizability, it will start trying to move of its own accord, and some even have the ability to speak. They usually do not have positive things to say.</p>

                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-infiltrator" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-infiltrator-list">
                    <p><em>Infiltrator Eidolons</em> have the ability to hide in some fashion, with a secondary ability it can use while it's hidden. Users of Infiltrator Eidolons tend to be introverted or shy individuals - they can be difficult to get a read on because they purposely hide things about themselves. Some may believe an Eidolon like this is inherently malevolent or implies something negative about its user, but we here at the ESL see the <em>potential</em> in these Eidolons. Spies and soldiers aren't the only individuals who need to use stealth to get what they want, after all. Infiltrator Eidolons can only hide when they aren't being viewed under most normal circumstances, and can stay hidden for seemingly arbitrary amounts of time dependent on if people are looking for them and what they do while they're hidden. Users of Infiltrator Eidolons also tend to know how to pick locks or hack computers that they previously might not have had, though it's also just as likely that those with such skills are more likely to have Infiltrator Eidolons. At their best, they can be utterly undetectable until its too late, often giving them an advantage in whatever situation they're in. But when things go wrong for them, they're utterly helpless as their Eidolon can outright become unusable...</p>
                    <p>Dr. Akemi's Eidolon <em>[Escape of Salmholfer the Witch]</em> resembles a woman in a black dress which can transform into an apple, which she can then throw. While her Eidolon is an apple, non-Eidolon users can see it. Dr. Akemi is the first of us to get an Eidolon - we don't know where she got it, just that it seems to be what inspired Dr. Rikimaru to propose Project Sleep to the officials funding the ESL. It's a simple Eidolon, but has proven useful - especially since it seems she can hide along her Eidolon in the apple and send the apple flying with her own will. Being able to become an object as small as an apple and still move swiftly means they can easily get into areas that normal humans cannot.</p>
                    <p>One of our anonymous test subjects got an Infiltrator Eidolon, <em>[Cantarella]</em>, resembling a creature made out of flowers that rather than hiding instead makes people hallucinate, and while doing so it can also poison them. This poison enters the blood system through the skin and also seems to attack the brain through the nervous system, making it harder for the victim to shake the hallucination. The poison cannot be identified by our current technology.</p>
